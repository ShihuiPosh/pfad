##introduction
The three code files in the document implement music generation based on user input. Users can generate music styles by describing them via voice, which is more convenient and faster than typing. The code utilizes the AudioLDM2 model, converting the user's description into text using the speech recognition library, and then generates the corresponding music for real-time playback. One version runs on a CPU (as my MacBook does not have a GPU), another version accelerates the music generation using a GPU, and the third version provides a simple interactive interface through Streamlit.
